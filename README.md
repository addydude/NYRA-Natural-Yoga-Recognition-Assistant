## About

**NYRA** (Natural Yoga Recognition Assistant) is an AI-powered yoga assistant that helps users perform yoga poses correctly and track their progress. 

Yoga is a great form of exercise with benefits including improved flexibility, strength, and reduced stress and anxiety. Research has shown that yoga can help improve metabolism, heart rate, and respiration. 

However, without proper knowledge about correct posture, people may suffer from acute pain and long-standing chronic problems. NYRA solves this by providing real-time guidance through an AI assistant that ensures users maintain proper form during their yoga practice.
